Introduction
A sommelier is a highly skilled wine professional having broad knowledge of wine service and food-wine pairing. While, computers cannot mimic human senses, this project aims to identify wines based on wine descriptions provided by people, similar to what a sommelier does. The dataset used here contains approximately 130000 wine reviews and 13 wine features including country of origin, price, variety, winery, taster name, and assigned points representing wine quality. This dataset is available online for public download at https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews.

Analyzing unstructured text data is especially important for sentiment analysis, spam filtering, recommendation systems, and translation. As computer models can only accept numerical values, any text data analysis requires several preliminary steps to convert flowing text into numerical values. This process is called feature engineering.
